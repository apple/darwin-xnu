#	Master machine independent configuration file.
#
#	Specific configuration files are created based on this and
#	the machine specific master file using the doconf script.
#
#	Any changes to the master configuration files will affect all
#	other configuration files based upon it.
#
#######################################################################
#
#	To build a configuration, execute "doconf <configuration>."
#	Configurations are specified in the "Configurations:" section
#	of the MASTER and MASTER.* files as follows:
#
#	<configuration> = [ <attribute0> <attribute1> ... <attributeN> ]
#
#	Lines in the MASTER and MASTER.* files are selected based on
#	the attribute selector list, found in a comment at the end of
#	the line.  This is a list of attributes separated by commas.
#	The "!" operator selects the line if none of the attributes are
#	specified.
#
#	For example:
#
#	<foo,bar>	selects a line if "foo" or "bar" are specified.
#	<!foo,bar>	selects a line if neither "foo" nor "bar" is
#			specified.
#
#	Lines with no attributes specified are selected for all
#	configurations.
