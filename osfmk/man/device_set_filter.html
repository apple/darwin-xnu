This service isprovided in support of network devices.<p>The filter command list consists of an array of up to <strong>NET_MAX_FILTER</strong> (16-bit) values to be applied to incoming data "messages" to determine if that data should be given to a particular input filter. <p>Each filter command list specifies a sequence of actions which leave a boolean value on the top of an internal stack.  Each 16-bit value of the command listspecifies a data (push) operation (high order <strong>NETF_NBPO</strong>bits) as well as a binary operator (low order <strong>NETF_NBPA</strong> bits).<p>The value to be pushed onto the stack is chosen as follows:<dl><dt> <strong>NETF_PUSHLIT</strong><dd>Use the next 16-bit value of the filter as the value.<dt> <strong>NETF_PUSHZERO</strong><dd>Use 0 as the value.<dt> <strong>NETF_PUSHWORD+</strong><var>N</var><dd>Use 16-bit value <var>N</var> of the "data" portion of the message as the value.<dt> <strong>NETF_PUSHHDR+</strong><var>N</var><dd>Use 16-bit value <var>N</var> of the "header" portion of the message as the value.<dt> <strong>NETF_PUSHIND</strong><dd>Pops the top 32-bit value from the stack and then uses it to index the 16-bit value of the "data" portion of the message to be used as thevalue.<dt> <strong>NETF_PUSHHDRIND</strong><dd>Pops the top 32-bit value from the stack and then uses it to index the 16-bit value of the "header" portion of the message to be used as the value.<dt> <strong>NETF_PUSHSTK+</strong><var>N</var><dd>Use 32-bit value <var>N</var> of the stack (where the top of stack is value 0) as the value.<dt> <strong>NETF_NOPUSH</strong><dd>Don't push a value.</dl>The unsigned value so chosen is promoted to a 32-bit value before being pushed.<p>Once a value is pushed (except for the case of <strong>NETF_NOPUSH</strong>), the top two 32-bit values of the stack are popped and a binary operator applied to them (with the old top of stack as the second operand).  The resultof the operator is pushed on the stack.  These operators are:<dl><dt> <strong>NETF_NOP</strong><dd>Don't pop off any values and do no operation.<dt> <strong>NETF_EQ</strong><dd>Perform an equal comparison.<dt> <strong>NETF_LT</strong><dd>Perform a less than comparison.<dt> <strong>NETF_LE</strong><dd>Perform a less than or equal comparison.<dt> <strong>NETF_GT</strong><dd>Perform a greater than comparison.<dt> <strong>NETF_GE</strong><dd>Perform a greater than or equal comparison.<dt> <strong>NETF_AND</strong><dd>Perform a bit-wise boolean AND operation.<dt> <strong>NETF_OR</strong><dd>Perform a bit-wise boolean inclusive OR operation.<dt> <strong>NETF_XOR</strong><dd>Perform a bit-wise boolean exclusive OR operation.<dt> <strong>NETF_NEQ</strong><dd>Perform a not equal comparison.<dt> <strong>NETF_LSH</strong><dd>Perform a left shift operation.<dt> <strong>NETF_RSH</strong><dd>Perform a right shift operation.<dt> <strong>NETF_ADD</strong><dd>Perform an addition.<dt> <strong>NETF_SUB</strong><dd>Perform a subtraction.<dt> <strong>NETF_COR</strong><dd>Perform an equal comparison.  If the comparison is <strong>TRUE</strong>, terminate the filter list.  Otherwise, pop the result of the comparison off the stack.<dt> <strong>NETF_CAND</strong><dd>Perform an equal comparison.  If the comparison is <strong>FALSE</strong>, terminate the filter list.  Otherwise, pop the result of the comparison off the stack.<dt> <strong>NETF_CNOR</strong><dd>Perform a not equal comparison.  If the comparison is <strong>FALSE</strong>,terminate the filter list.  Otherwise, pop the result of thecomparison off the stack.<dt> <strong>NETF_CNAND</strong><dd>Perform a not equal comparison.  If the comparison is <strong>TRUE</strong>, terminate the filter list.  Otherwise, pop the result of the comparison off the stack.</dl>The scan of the filter list terminates when the filter list is emptied, or a<strong>NETF_C</strong> operation terminates the list.  At this time, if the final value of the top of the stack is <strong>TRUE</strong>, then the message is acceptedfor the filter.<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><dl><p><dt> <strong>D_DEVICE_DOWN</strong><dd>Device has been shut down<p><dt> <strong>D_INVALID_OPERATION</strong><dd>No filter port was supplied.<p><dt> <strong>D_NO_SUCH_DEVICE</strong><dd>No device with that name, or the device is not operational.</dl><h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Currently no references.
