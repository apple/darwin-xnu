This property should be assigned to threads in thedefault page-out path.  Threads not in the default page-out pathshould not have this property to prevent the kernel's free list of pages from being exhausted.<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><dl><p><dt> <strong>KERN_INVALID_ARGUMENT</strong><dd><var>thread</var> is not a thread port..P<var>host_priv</var> is not the control port for the host on which <var>thread</var>executes.</dl><h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Functions:<a href="vm_wire.html"><strong>vm_wire</strong></a>.
