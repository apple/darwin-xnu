The mapped memory will start at the beginning of the page containing <var>target_address</var>.  If there is not enough roomfollowing the address, the kernel does not map the memory.  The kernelreturns the starting address actually used for the mapped memory.     <p><dt> <var>size</var> <dd>[in scalar]The number of bytes to map.  The kernel rounds this number up to an integral number of virtual pages.<p><dt> <var>mask</var> <dd>[in scalar]Alignment restrictions for starting address.  Bits turned on in the mask will not be turned on in the starting address.<p><dt> <var>anywhere</var> <dd>[in scalar]Placement indicator.     The valid values are:<dl><p>  <dt> <strong>TRUE</strong><dd>The kernel allocates the region in the next unused space that is sufficient within the address space.  The kernel returns the starting address actually used in <var>address</var>.<p><dt> <strong>FALSE</strong><dd>The kernel allocates the region starting at <var>address</var> unless that space is already allocated.</dl><p><dt> <var>source_task</var> <dd>[in task send right]The port for the task whose address space is to be mapped.<p><dt> <var>source_address</var> <dd>[in scalar]The starting address for the memory to be mapped from the source task.  The memory to be mapped will start at the beginning of the page containing <var>source_address</var>.  If not enough memory existsfollowing the address, the kernel does not map the memory.<p><dt> <var>copy</var> <dd>[in scalar]Copy indicator.  If true, the kernel copies the region for the memory to the specified task's address space.  If false, the region is mapped read-write.<p><dt> <var>cur_protection</var> <dd>[out scalar]The most restrictive current protection for the memory in the region.  Valid values are obtained by or'ing together the following values:<dl><p>  <dt> <strong>VM_PROT_READ</strong><dd>Allows read access.<p><dt> <strong>VM_PROT_WRITE</strong><dd>Allows write access.<p><dt> <strong>VM_PROT_EXECUTE</strong><dd>Allows execute access.</dl><p><dt> <var>max_protection</var> <dd>[out scalar]The most restrictive maximum protection for the memory in the region.  Values are the same as for <var>cur_protection</var>.<p><dt> <var>inheritance</var> <dd>[in scalar]The initial inheritance attribute for the region.  Valid values are:<dl><p>  <dt> <strong>VM_INHERIT_SHARE</strong><dd>Allows child tasks to share the region.<p><dt> <strong>VM_INHERIT_COPY</strong><dd>Gives child tasks a copy of the region.<p><dt> <strong>VM_INHERIT_NONE</strong><dd>Provides no access to the region for child tasks.</dl></dl><h3>DESCRIPTION</h3><p>The <strong>vm_remap</strong> function maps the memory objects underlyinga portion of the specified <var>source_task</var>'s virtual address space into the addressspace belonging to <var>target_task</var>.  The target task can be the calling task or anothertask, identified by its task kernel port.  The effect is as if the target task performeda <strong>vm_map</strong> call given the same memory object, maximum protection, currentprotection, and inheritance as the source task.However, the two tasks must reside on the same host.  The kernel maps the memory objectsstarting at <var>target_address</var>, so that access to <var>target_address</var>is as if the source taskaccessed its <var>source_address</var>.<p>The <var>mask</var> parameter specifies additional alignment restrictions on the kernel's selection of the starting address.  Uses for this mask include:<ul><li>Forcing the memory address alignment for a mapping to be the same as the alignment within the source task.<li>Quickly finding the beginning of an allocated region by performing bitarithmetic on an address known to be in the region.<li>Emulating a larger virtual page size.</ul>The <var>cur_protection</var> and <var>max_protection</var> parameters return the protectionattributes for the mapped memory.  If all memory within the range had the sameattributes, these attributes are returned; otherwise the call returns the most restrictive values for any memory in the region.<h3>NOTES</h3><p>This interface is machine word length specific because of the virtual addressparameter.<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><dl><p>  <dt> <strong>KERN_NO_SPACE</strong><dd>There is not enough space in the task's address space to allocate the new region for the memory object.<p><dt> <strong>KERN_PROTECTION_FAILURE</strong><dd>Specified memory is valid, but the backing memory manager isnot permitted by the requesting task.</dl><h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Functions:<a href="vm_map.html"><strong>vm_map</strong></a>,<a href="vm_read.html"><strong>vm_read</strong></a>,<a href="vm_write.html"><strong>vm_write</strong></a>.
