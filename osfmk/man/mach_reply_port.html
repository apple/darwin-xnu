<h2>mach_reply_port</h2><hr><p><strong>System Trap</strong> - Allocate a new port and insert corresponding receive right in the calling task.<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3><pre><strong>#include&ltmach/mach_traps.h&gt</strong><strong>mach_port_t   mach_reply_port( void )</strong></pre><h3>PARAMETERS</h3><dl>None.</dl><h3>DESCRIPTION</h3><p>The <strong>mach_reply_port</strong> function creates a new port forthe current task andreturns the name assigned by the kernel.  The kernel recordsthe name in the task's port name space and grants the task receive rights for the port.The new port is not a member of any port set.<p>This function is an optimized version of <strong>mach_port_allocate</strong>that uses no port references.  Its main purpose is to allocate a reply port forthe task when the task is starting, for example, before it has any ports to use as replyports for any IPC-based system functions.<p>If the task's task self port is null (thereby deactivating basic Machmanipulations by the task), this call returns null.<h3>CAUTIONS</h3><p>Although the created port can be used for any purpose, the implementation may optimize its use as a reply port.<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><dl><dt> <strong>MACH_PORT_NULL</strong><dd>No port was allocated.     <p><dt> [reply receive right]<dd>Any other value indicates success.</dl><h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Functions:<a href="mach_port_allocate.html"><strong>mach_port_allocate</strong></a>.
