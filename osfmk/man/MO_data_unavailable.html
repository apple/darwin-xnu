<h2>memory_object_data_unavailable</h2><hr><p><strong>Function</strong> - Instruct kernel to zero-fill pages as requested data does not exist.<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3><pre><strong>kern_return_t   memory_object_data_unavailable</strong>                <strong>(memory_object_control_t</strong>         <var>memory_control</var>,                 <strong>vm_offset_t</strong>                             <var>offset</var>,                 <strong>vm_size_t</strong>                                 <var>size</var><strong>);</strong></pre><h3>PARAMETERS</h3><dl><p><dt> <var>memory_control</var> <dd>[in memory-cache-control send right]The memory cache control port to be used by the memory manager for cache management requests. This port is provided by the kernel in a <strong>memory_object_init</strong> or a <strong>memory_object_create</strong> call.<p><dt> <var>offset</var> <dd>[in scalar]The offset within the memory object, in bytes.<p><dt> <var>size</var> <dd>[in scalar]The number of bytes of data (starting at <var>offset</var>).  The number must convert to an integral number of memory object pages.</dl><h3>DESCRIPTION</h3><p>The <strong>memory_object_data_unavailable</strong> function indicatesthat the memory manager cannot provide the kernel with the data requested forthe given region. Instead, the kernel should provide the data for this region.<p>A memory manager can use this call in any of the following situations:<ul><li>When the object was created by the kernel (via <strong>memory_object_create</strong>) and the kernel has not yet provided data for the region (via either<strong>memory_object_data_initialize</strong> or <strong>memory_object_data_return</strong>).In this case, theobject is a temporary memory object; the memory manager is the default memory manager; and the kernel should provide zero-filled pages for theobject.     <p><li>When the object is a normal user-created memory object.  In this case, the kernel should provide zero-filled pages for the region.</ul><h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><p>Only generic errors apply.<h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Functions:<a href="memory_object_create.html"><strong>memory_object_create</strong></a>,<a href="memory_object_data_error.html"><strong>memory_object_data_error</strong></a>,<a href="memory_object_data_request.html"><strong>memory_object_data_request</strong></a>,<a href="memory_object_data_supply.html"><strong>memory_object_data_supply</strong></a>.
