Since this is a hint, it may be incorrect; it is ignored if it doesn't specify a thread on the same host as the current thread or if the scheduler cannot switch to that thread (i.e., not runable or already running on another processor).  In thiscase, the normal logic to select the next thread to run is used; the current threadmay continue running if there is no other appropriate thread to run.<p>The <var>option</var> argument specifies the interpretation and use of <var>time</var>.The possible values (from \*L<mach/thread_switch.h>\*O) are:<dl><dt> <strong>SWITCH_OPTION_NONE</strong><dd>The <var>time</var> argument is ignored.<dt> <strong>SWITCH_OPTION_WAIT</strong><dd>The thread is blocked for the specified <var>time</var>.  This wait cannot becanceled by <strong>thread_resume</strong>; only <strong>thread_abort</strong> can terminate this wait.<dt> <strong>SWITCH_OPTION_DEPRESS</strong><dd>The thread's scheduling attributes are temporarily set so as to provide it with the lowest possible service for duration <var>time</var>.  The schedulingdepression is aborted when <var>time</var> has passed, when the current thread is next run (either via hand-off scheduling or because the processor set has nothing better to do), or when <strong>thread_abort</strong> or<strong>thread_depress_abort</strong> is applied to the current thread.Changing the thread's scheduling attributes (via <strong>thread_policy</strong>) will not affect this depression.<dt> <strong>SWITCH_OPTION_IDLE</strong><dd>This option is similar to <strong>SWITCH_OPTION_DEPRESS</strong> however, the thread's scheduling attributes are temporarily set so as to place it at a service level that is below all runnable threads for duration <var>time</var>.  The scheduling depression is aborted when <var>time</var> has passed, when the current thread is next run (either via hand-off scheduling or because the processor set has nothing better to do), or when <strong>thread_abort</strong> or<strong>thread_depress_abort</strong> is applied to the current thread.Changing the thread's scheduling attributes (via <strong>thread_policy</strong>) will not affect this depression.</dl><p>The minimum time and units of time can be obtained as the <var>min_timeout</var> value from the <strong>HOST_SCHED_INFO</strong> flavor of <strong>host_info</strong>.<h3>NOTES</h3><p><strong>thread_switch</strong> is often called when the current threadcan proceed no further for some reason; the various options and arguments allow information about this reason to be transmitted to the kernel.  The <var>new_thread</var>argument (hand-off scheduling) is useful when the identity of the thread that must make progressbefore the current thread runs again is known.  The <strong>SWITCH_OPTION_WAIT</strong>option is used when the amount of time that the current threadmust wait before it can do anything useful can be estimated and is fairly short,especially when the identity of the thread for which this thread must wait is not known.<h3>CAUTIONS</h3><p>Users should beware of calling <strong>thread_switch</strong> with aninvalid hint (e.g., <strong>THREAD_NULL</strong>) and no option.  Because the time-sharing scheduler varies the priority of threads based on usage, this may result in a wasteof CPU time if the thread that must be run is of lower priority.  The use of the <strong>SWITCH_OPTION_DEPRESS</strong> option in this situation is highly recommended.<p><strong>thread_switch</strong> ignores policies.  Users relying on thepreemption semantics of a fixed time policy should be aware that <strong>thread_switch</strong>ignores these semantics; it will run the specified <var>new_thread</var> independent of its schedulingattributes and those of any threads that could run instead.<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><p>Only generic errors apply.<h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Functions:<a href="thread_abort.html"><strong>thread_abort</strong></a>,<a href="thread_depress_abort.html"><strong>thread_depress_abort</strong></a>.
