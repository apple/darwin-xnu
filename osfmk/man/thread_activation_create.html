The RPC_port must name ei- ther a receive right held by thetask, or a port set in the task.  The new thread activation will beadded to a pool of activations attached to this port (or port set).Incoming RPC's targeted at the port (or one of the ports in the set)can use any of the activations in the pool.  That is, the clientthread shuttle will migrate into the specified server task, take oneof the thread activations out of the pool, and join up with it for theduration of the RPC.  The shuttle will migrate back to the originalclient activation at the end of the RPC.  If no thread activations arein the pool, RPC will be blocked until one is created in the pool, oran existing one finishes its RPC and returns to the pool.The new thread activation will begin each RPC using the stack pointerspecified by user_stack.  The kernel neither knows nor cares how bigthe specified stack is.When a short-circuited RPC (or mach_rpc) is invoked on a port createdwith mach_port_allocate_subsystem, the RPC will begin execution in thesubsystem server at the work function address specified by the portand routine number and looked up in the associated subsystem data.<h3>NOTES</h3><p>The following calls targeted at a thread_act port may _not_ be calledon an empty thread_act (and will return KERN_INVALID_ARGUMENT ifthey are called with one):thread_abortthread_abort_safelythread_depress_abortthread_infothread_wireIn addition, if thread_switch is called with an empty thread_act asits first argument, the argument will be ignored (i.e., the functionwill behave as if a zero-valued argument had been given).<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><p>Only generic errors apply.<h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Functions:<a href="task_create.html"><strong>task_create</strong></a>,<a href="MP_allocate_subsystem.html"><strong>mach_port_allocate_subsystem</strong></a>,
