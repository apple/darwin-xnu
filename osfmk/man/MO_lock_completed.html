Because the memory manager cannot know which pages have been modified, or even which pages remain in the cache, it cannot know how many pages will be written back in response to a <strong>memory_object_lock_request</strong> call.  Receiving the<strong>memory_object_lock_completed</strong> call is the only suremeans of detecting completion.  The completion call includes the offset and length values from the consistency requestto distinguish it from other consistency requests.<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><p>Only generic errors apply.<h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Functions:<a href="memory_object_lock_request.html"><strong>memory_object_lock_request</strong></a>,<a href="memory_object_server.html"><strong>memory_object_server</strong></a>,<a href="SMO_server.html"><strong>seqnos_memory_object_server</strong></a>.
