The kernel makes thiscall only to the system default memory manager.<p>The new memory object initially consists of zero-filled pages.  Only memory pages that are actually written are provided to the memory manager.  Whenprocessing <strong>memory_object_data_request</strong> calls from thekernel, the defaultmemory manager must use <strong>memory_object_data_unavailable</strong>for any pages that have not been written previously.<p>The kernel does not expect a reply to this call.  The kernel assumes that thedefault memory manager will be ready to handle data requests to this object and does not need the confirmation of a <strong>memory_object_change_attributes</strong> call.<h3>NOTES</h3><p>The kernel requires memory objects to provide temporary backing storage for zero-filled memory created by <strong>vm_allocate</strong> calls, issuedby both user tasks and the kernel itself.  The kernel allocates an abstract memory object port torepresent the temporary backing storage and uses <strong>memory_object_create</strong>to pass the new memory object to the default memory manager, which provides the storage.<p>The default memory manager is a trusted system component that is identified to the kernel at system initialization time.  The default memory manager can also be changed at run time using the <strong>host_default_memory_manager</strong> call.<p>The contents of a kernel-created (as opposed to a user-created) memory object can be modified only in main memory.  The default memory manager must not change the contents of a temporary memory object, or allow unrelated tasks to access the memory object, control, or name port.<p>The kernel provides the size of a temporary memory object based on theallocated size.  Since the object is not mapped by other tasks,the object will not grow by explicit action.  However, the kernel may coalesce adjacenttemporary objects in such a way that this object may appear to grow.  As such,the supplied object size is merely a hint as to the maximum size.<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><p>Only generic errors apply.<h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Functions:<a href="DP_object_create.html"><strong>default_pager_object_create</strong></a>,<a href="MO_data_initialize.html"><strong>memory_object_data_initialize</strong></a>,<a href="MO_data_unavailable.html"><strong>memory_object_data_unavailable</strong></a>,<a href="MO_default_server.html"><strong>memory_object_default_server</strong></a>,<a href="SMO_default_server.html"><strong>seqnos_memory_object_default_server</strong></a>.
