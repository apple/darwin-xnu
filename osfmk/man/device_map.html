The resulting port is suitablefor use as thememory manager port in a <strong>vm_map</strong> call.  This call is device dependent.<h3>NOTES</h3><p>Port rights are maintained as follows:<ul><li>Memory object port: the device memory manager has all rights.<li>Memory cache control port: the device memory manager has only send rights.</ul><p>Regardless of how the object is created, the control port is created by the kernel and passed through the memory management interface.<p>If the device port used is restricted to use by a single identity,the generatedrepresentative port will be likewise restricted.<h3>CAUTIONS</h3><p>The device memory manager assumes that access to its memory objects will not be propagated to more that one host, and therefore provides no consistencyguarantees beyond those made by the kernel.<p>In the event that more than one host attempts to use a devicememory object, the device memory manager will only record the last set of port names.  Currently, the device memory manager assumes that its clients adhere tothe initialization and termination protocols in the memory management interface; otherwise, port rights or out-of-line memory from erroneous messages may be allowed toaccumulate.<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><dl><p><dt> <strong>D_DEVICE_DOWN</strong><dd>Device has been shut down<p><dt> <strong>D_NO_SUCH_DEVICE</strong><dd>No device with that name, or the device is not operational.<p><dt> <strong>D_READ_ONLY</strong><dd>Data cannot be written to this device.</dl><h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Functions:<a href="vm_map.html"><strong>vm_map</strong></a>.
