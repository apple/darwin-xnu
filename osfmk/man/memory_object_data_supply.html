The number must be an integral number of memory object pages.<p><p><dt> <var>deallocate</var> <dd>[in scalar]If <strong>TRUE</strong>, the pages to be copied (starting at data) will bedeallocated from the memory manager's address space as a result ofbeing copied into the message, allowing the pages to be moved into the kernel instead of being physically copied.<p><p><dt> <var>lock_value</var> <dd>[in scalar]One or more forms of access <var>not</var> permitted for the specified data.  Valid values are:<dl><p><p><dt> <strong>VM_PROT_NONE</strong><dd>Prohibits no access (that is, all forms of access are permitted).<p><p><dt> <strong>VM_PROT_READ</strong><dd>Prohibits read access.<p><p><dt> <strong>VM_PROT_WRITE</strong><dd>Prohibits write access.<p><p><dt> <strong>VM_PROT_EXECUTE</strong><dd>Prohibits execute access.<p><p><dt> <strong>VM_PROT_ALL</strong><dd>Prohibits all forms of access.</dl><p><p><dt> <var>precious</var> <dd>[in scalar]If <strong>TRUE</strong>, the pages being supplied are "precious," that is, the memory manager is not (necessarily) retaining its own copy.  These pages must be returned to the manager when evicted from memory, even if not modified.<p><p><dt> <var>reply_port</var> <dd>[in reply receive (to be converted to send) right]A port to which the kernel should send a <strong>memory_object_supply_completed</strong> to indicate the status of the accepted data.  <strong>MACH_PORT_NULL</strong> is allowed.  The reply message indicates which pages have been accepted.</dl><h3>DESCRIPTION</h3><p>The <strong>memory_object_data_supply</strong> function supplies thekernel with a range of data for the specified memory object.  A memory manager can only provide data that was requested by a <strong>memory_object_data_request</strong>call from the kernel.<h3>NOTES</h3><p>The kernel accepts only integral numbers of pages.  It discardsany partial pages without notification.<h3>CAUTIONS</h3><p>A memory manager must be careful that it not attempt to provide data that has not been explicitly requested.  In particular, a memory managermust ensure that it does not provide writable data again before it receives back modifications from the kernel.  This may require that the memory manager remember which pages it has provided, or that it exercise other cache control functions (via<strong>memory_object_lock_request</strong>) before proceeding.  The kernel prohibits theoverwriting of live data pages and will not accept pages it has not requested.<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><p>Only generic errors apply.<h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Functions:<a href="memory_object_data_error.html"><strong>memory_object_data_error</strong></a>,<a href="memory_object_data_request.html"><strong>memory_object_data_request</strong></a>,<a href="MO_data_unavailable.html"><strong>memory_object_data_unavailable</strong></a>,<a href="memory_object_lock_request.html"><strong>memory_object_lock_request</strong></a>,<a href="MO_supply_completed.html"><strong>memory_object_supply_completed</strong></a>.
