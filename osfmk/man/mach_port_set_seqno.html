<h2>mach_port_set_seqno</h2><hr><p><strong>Function</strong> - Change the current value of the target port's sequence number.<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3><pre><strong>kern_return_t   mach_port_set_seqno</strong>                <strong>(ipc_space_t</strong>                               <var>task</var>,                 <strong>mach_port_name_t</strong>                          <var>name</var>,                 <strong>mach_port_seqno_t</strong>                        <var>seqno</var><strong>);</strong></pre><h3>PARAMETERS</h3><dl><p><dt> <var>task</var> <dd>[in task send right]The task owning the receive right.<p><dt> <var>name</var> <dd>[in scalar]<var>task</var>'s name for the receive right.<p><dt> <var>seqno</var> <dd>[in scalar]The sequence number that the next message received from the port will have.</dl><h3>DESCRIPTION</h3><p>The <strong>mach_port_set_seqno</strong> function changes the sequencenumber of <var>task</var>'sreceive right named <var>name</var>.<p>(Each port is associated with a sequence number attribute that can beused to track the order in which messages sent to the port are received.A port's sequence number is initially set to zero and is incremented eachtime a message is received from the port.  A port's sequence number isautomatically reset to zero each time the port's receive right migrates.)<h3>NOTES</h3><p>This interface is machine word length specific because of the port nameparameter.<h3>RETURN VALUES</h3><dl><p><dt> <strong>KERN_INVALID_NAME</strong><dd><var>name</var> did not denote a right.<p><dt> <strong>KERN_INVALID_RIGHT</strong><dd><var>name</var> denoted a right, but not a receive right.</dl><h3>RELATED INFORMATION</h3><p>Functions:<a href="mach_port_get_attributes.html"><strong>mach_port_get_attributes</strong></a>.
