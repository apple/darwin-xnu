     * through the section headers for a library file they are separated into
     * groups of local and external entries further grouped by module.  In this
     * case the presents of this load command who's extreloff, nextrel,
     * locreloff and nlocrel fields are non-zero indicates that the relocation
     * entries of non-merged sections are not referenced through the section
     * structures (and the reloff and nreloc fields in the section headers are
     * set to zero).
     *
     * Since the relocation entries are not accessed through the section headers
     * this requires the r_address field to be something other than a section
     * offset to identify the item to be relocated.  In this case r_address is
     * set to the offset from the vmaddr of the first LC_SEGMENT command.
     *
     * The relocation entries are grouped by module and the module table
     * entries have indexes and counts into them for the group of external
     * relocation entries for that the module.
     *
     * For sections that are merged across modules there must not be any
     * remaining external relocation entries for them (for merged sections
     * remaining relocation entries must be local).
