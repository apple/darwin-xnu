.Sh NAME
.Nm statfs,
.Nm fstatfs
.Nd get file system statistics
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/param.h>
.Fd #include <sys/mount.h>
.Ft int
.Fn statfs "const char *path" "struct statfs *buf"
.Ft int
.Fn fstatfs "int fd" "struct statfs *buf"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Statfs
returns information about a mounted file system.
.Fa Path
is the path name of any file within the mounted file system.
.Fa Buf
is a pointer to a 
.Fa statfs
structure defined as follows:
.Bd -literal
typedef struct { int32_t val[2]; } fsid_t;

#define MFSTYPENAMELEN  16 /* length of fs type name including null */
#define MAXPATHLEN      1024	

struct statfs {
    uint32_t        f_bsize;        /* fundamental file system block size */ 
    int32_t         f_iosize;       /* optimal transfer block size */ 
    uint64_t        f_blocks;       /* total data blocks in file system */ 
    uint64_t        f_bfree;        /* free blocks in fs */ 
    uint64_t        f_bavail;       /* free blocks avail to non-superuser */ 
    uint64_t        f_files;        /* total file nodes in file system */ 
    uint64_t        f_ffree;        /* free file nodes in fs */ 
    fsid_t          f_fsid;         /* file system id */ 
    uid_t           f_owner;        /* user that mounted the filesystem */ 
    uint32_t        f_type;         /* type of filesystem */ 
    uint32_t        f_flags;        /* copy of mount exported flags */ 
    uint32_t        f_fssubtype;    /* fs sub-type (flavor) */ 
    char            f_fstypename[MFSTYPENAMELEN];   /* fs type name */ 
    char            f_mntonname[MAXPATHLEN];        /* directory on which mounted */ 
    char            f_mntfromname[MAXPATHLEN];      /* mounted filesystem */ 
    uint32_t        f_reserved[8];  /* For future use */ 
};
.Ed
.Pp
Fields that are undefined for a particular file system are set to -1.
.Fn Fstatfs
returns the same information about an open file referenced by descriptor
.Fa fd .
.Sh FLAGS
.Bl -tag -width MNT_UNKOWNPERMISSIONS
These are some of the flags that may be present in the f_flags field. 
.It Dv MNT_RDONLY
A read-only filesystem
.It Dv MNT_SYNCHRONOUS
File system is written to synchronously
.It Dv MNT_NOEXEC
Can't exec from filesystem
.It Dv MNT_NOSUID
Setuid bits are not honored on this filesystem
.It Dv MNT_NODEV
Don't interpret special files
.It Dv MNT_UNION
Union with underlying filesysten
.It Dv MNT_ASYNC
File system written to asynchronously
.It Dv MNT_EXPORTED
File system is exported
.it Dv MNT_LOCAL
File system is stored locally
.It Dv MNT_QUOTA
Quotas are enabled on this file system
.It Dv MNT_ROOTFS
This file system is the root of the file system
.It Dv MNT_DOVOLFS
File system supports volfs
.It Dv MNT_DONTBROWSE
File system is not appropriate path to user data
.It Dv MNT_UNKNOWNPERMISSIONS
VFS will ignore ownership information on filesystem objects
.It Dv MNT_AUTOMOUNTED
File system was mounted by automounter
.It Dv MNT_JOURNALED
File system is journaled
.It Dv MNT_DEFWRITE
File system should defer writes
.It Dv MNT_MULTILABEL

.El
.Sh CAVEATS
In Mac OS X versions before 10.4, f_iosize is 4096. On these older
systems, use MAXBSIZE instead.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, -1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn Statfs
fails if one or more of the following are true:
.Bl -tag -width Er

.Fa Path
is not a directory.
.It Bq Er ENAMETOOLONG
The length of a component of
.Fa path
exceeds 
.Dv {NAME_MAX}
characters, or the length of
.Fa path
exceeds 
.Dv {PATH_MAX}
characters.
.It Bq Er ENOENT
The file referred to by
.Fa path
does not exist.
