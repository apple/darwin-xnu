.Fd #include <unistd.h>

.Fn mknod "const char *path" "mode_t mode" "dev_t dev"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The device special file
.Fa path
is created with the major and minor
device numbers extracted from
.Fa mode.
The access permissions of
.Fa path
are descendant from the

of the parent process.
.Pp
If
.Fa mode
indicates a block or character special file,
.Fa dev
is a configuration dependent specification of a character or block
I/O device and the superblock of the device.  If
.Fa mode
does not indicate a block special or character special device,
.Fa dev
is ignored.
.Pp
.Fn Mknod
requires super-user privileges.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion a value of 0 is returned.
Otherwise, a value of -1 is returned and
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
