.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn Read
attempts to read
.Fa nbyte
bytes of data from the object referenced by the descriptor
.Fa fildes
into the buffer pointed to by
.Fa buf .
.Fn Readv
performs the same action,
but scatters the input data into the
.Fa iovcnt
buffers specified by the members of the
.Fa iov
array: iov[0], iov[1], ..., iov[iovcnt\|\-\|1].
.Fn Pread
performs the same function,
but reads from the specified position in the file
without modifying the file pointer.
.Pp
For
.Fn readv ,
the
.Fa iovec
structure is defined as:
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
struct iovec {
	char   *iov_base;  /* Base address. */
	size_t iov_len;    /* Length. */
};
.Ed
.Pp
Each
.Fa iovec
entry specifies the base address and length of an area
in memory where data should be placed.
.Fn Readv
will always fill an area completely before proceeding
to the next.
.Pp
On objects capable of seeking, the
.Fn read
starts at a position
given by the pointer associated with
.Fa fildes
(see
.Xr lseek 2 ) .
Upon return from
.Fn read ,
the pointer is incremented by the number of bytes actually read.
.Pp
Objects that are not capable of seeking always read from the current
position.  The value of the pointer associated with such an
object is undefined.
.Pp
Upon successful completion,
.Fn read ,
.Fn readv ,
and
.Fn pread
return the number of bytes actually read and placed in the buffer.
The system guarantees to read the number of bytes requested if
the descriptor references a normal file that has that many bytes left
before the end-of-file, but in no other case.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If successful, the
number of bytes actually read is returned.
Upon reading end-of-file,
zero is returned.
Otherwise, a -1 is returned and the global variable
.Va errno
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn pread ,
.Fn read ,
and
.Fn readv
calls
will succeed unless:
.Bl -tag -width Er

.\" ===========
.It Bq Er EINVAL
The sum of the
.Fa iov_len
values in the
.Fa iov
array overflowed a 32-bit integer.
